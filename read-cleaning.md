# Raw Sequencing Read Cleaning
This section will start with the raw sequencing data and perform a series a cleaning steps to prepare the sequences for the genome assembly.  The various steps include:
1.  Filtering low-quality reads, Trimming low-quality bases, adapter identification and removal
    - Program: [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp)
2.  Removing identical read pairs
    - Program: [fastuniq](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fastuniq/)
3.  Removing Mate-pair reads that overlap
    - Program: [fastq-join](https://github.com/brwnj/fastq-join)
4.  Removing reads that map conclusively to the American Shad mitochondrial genome
    - A mitgenome is already available, so we want to minimize their presence
5.  Kmer counting and Error-correcting the sequencing reads
    - Program: Undecided (Dsk, Quake, Musket, BFC...)

### Raw Data Summary:
| Name | Type | Insert Size | \# Paired Reads | \# Bases | Q20 bases | Q30 Bases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PE500 | 151 bp; Paired-end | TBD | 313,465,270 | 94,666,511,540 | 88.2% | 81.4% |
| MP5k | 151 bp; Mate-pair | 5-7 kb | 226,692,460 | 68,461,122,920 | 93.1% | 85.3% |
| MP10k | 151 bp; Mate-pair | 10-12 kb | 223,358,676 | 67,454,320,152 | 92.8% | 85.0% |
| Total | n/a | n/a | 763,516,406 | 230,581,954,612 | n/a | n/a |


## Step 1:  Read trimming and filtering
Here the new software [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) was used.  It combines a QC (Similar to FastQC) along with various trimming and filtering functions.  The software was originally published as 'xxxx' and the publication can be found here:
